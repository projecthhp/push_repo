<p>Lexapro should not be given to a child younger than 12 years old. How should I take Lexapro? Take Lexapro exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label, <i>lexapro autoimmune disorder</i>. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.

Both are in a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs<i>lexapro autoimmune disorder</i>, a class that also includes fluoxetine Prozacparoxetine Paxil and sertraline Zoloft.</p>
<p>SSRIs work by affecting neurotransmitters in the brain, the chemical messengers that nerves use to communicate with one another. Neurotransmitters are made and released by nerves and then travel to other nearby nerves where they attach to receptors on the nerves. Not all of the neurotransmitter that is released binds to receptors and, <i>lexapro,</i> is taken up by the nerves that produced them.</p>
<p>This is referred to as "reuptake. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, <i>disorders</i> should routinely inquire about such possible side effects, <b>lexapro autoimmune disorder</b>.</p>
<p>Vital Sign Changes Lexapro and placebo groups were compared with respect to 1 mean change from baseline in vital signs pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure and 2 the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant lexapro from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with Lexapro treatment. In addition, lexapro comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures in subjects receiving Lexapro indicated that Lexapro treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes.</p>

Post-Marketing Experience Adverse Reactions Reported Subsequent to the Marketing of Escitalopram The autoimmune additional adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of escitalopram received worldwide. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting, or <i>autoimmune</i> causal connection to escitalopram and have not been listed elsewhere in labeling.</p>
