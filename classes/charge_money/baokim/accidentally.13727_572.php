<p>I can't find any information that says this is a side effect. I'm wondering if it's just my body adjusting to the new medicine?</p><img src="http://pillbox.nlm.nih.gov/assets/large/005910860.jpg" alt="accidentally took two 20mg lisinopril" title="accidentally took two 20mg lisinopril" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="422" height="200" align="left" ><p>I also take oral contraceptives, which keep my cycle regular to the hour almost. Anyone ever had this as a side effect? I am 59 and past that.</p><h2>Bad karma: we can't find that page!</h2><p>But of course any time one starts a new medication, the body responds in some way or lisinopril. I know from years ago accidentally Lisinopril took birth control pills, it is not unusual to have short, brief periods when on oral contraceptivesbut that is a good question Thanks for your Reply!</p>
<p>I have been taking lisinopril for about 2 months now, <i>accidentally took two 20mg lisinopril</i>. I have went back to see my DR.
