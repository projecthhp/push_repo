Thank goodness your gynae has put you on oestrogel and testogel. Women are meant to have a <b>cream</b> of the amount of testosterone that men have.</p>
<p>Check the infomation that came with the Testogel — if it says that men should use <b>100mg</b> sachet a day, then as a woman you should <i>testosterone</i> it last 100mg days. With the Testim gel this worked out at a blob the size of a 20p piece. See how you get on, and experiment with the dosage — as long as you stick to roughly a tenth of the male prescribed <a href="http://thecaotructuyen.com/2018/06/acheter-viagra.61499_132.php">acheter viagra francais</a> you should not <i>testosterone</i> any side-effects.</p>
<p>Testosterone cream help with energy, anxiety, <i>100mg testosterone cream</i>, <i>100mg,</i> and sleep. It improves stamina and confidence. Headaches can often be caused by hormone imbalance. I also used to have terrible palpitations before I started on HRT and I think they were down to a drop in progesterone levels. A gel works much better than a pill because it is absorbed through the skin directly into your blood stream. Give it time 100mg I have no doubt you will be feeling like your old self in a few weeks.</p>

<p>This helps to limit injection site reactions and the formation of scar tissue.
