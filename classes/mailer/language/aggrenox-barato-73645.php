		<p><p>Before taking this medicine You should not use Aggrenox if you are allergic to aspirin or dipyridamole, or if you have: Do not give this medicine to a child or teenager with a fever, flu symptoms, or chicken pox. Aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome, a serious and sometimes fatal condition in children. To make sure Aggrenox is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have: Taking aspirin during late pregnancy may cause bleeding in the mother or the baby during delivery.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking Aggrenox. Aspirin and dipyridamole can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p>
<p>How should I take Aggrenox? Take Aggrenox exactly as it was prescribed for you. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results.</p>
<p>Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. You may take Aggrenox with or without food. Do not take other aspirin products unless directed by your doctor or health care professional. Many non-prescription medicines contain aspirin. To prevent accidental overdose, read labels carefully and do not take more than one product that contains aspirin. Notify your doctor or health care professional and seek emergency treatment if you develop breathing problems; changes in vision; chest pain; severe, sudden headache; pain, swelling, warmth in the leg; trouble speaking; sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg.</p>
<p>These can be signs that your condition has gotten worse. If you have diabetes, this medicine may affect your blood sugar levels. Check with your doctor or health care professional before you change your diet or the dose of your diabetes medicine. Aspirin can irritate your stomach. Drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes can make this irritation worse and may cause ulcers or bleeding problems.</p>
<p>Moderate The combined use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and aspirin, ASA may elevate the risk for an upper GI bleed. SSRIs may inhibit serotonin uptake by platelets, augmenting the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. Additionally, aspirin impairs the gastric mucosa defenses by inhibiting prostaglandin formation. Citric Acid; Potassium Citrate: Moderate Urinary alkalinizing agents, like potassium citrate, increase the excretion of salicylates by increasing renal clearance.</p>
<p>Citric Acid; Sodium Citrate: Moderate Due to the thrombocytopenic effects of purine analogs, an additive risk of bleeding may be seen in patients receiving concomitant platelet inhibitors. Moderate Clomipramine may inhibit serotonin uptake by platelets, augmenting the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. This may increase the risk for an upper GI bleed.</p>
<p>Moderate Although aspirin may be used in combination with clopidogrel, both drugs are associated with bleeding. In clinical trials, bleeding rates with concomitant use of aspirin and clopidogrel vs. Major Renal impairment, which may include hypophosphatemia, has been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a majority of the cases occurring in patients who have underlying systemic or renal disease or who are concurrently taking nephrotoxic agents. Tenofovir should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent; patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, like salicylates should be carefully monitored for changes in serum creatinine and phosphorus.</p>
<p>Moderate Because fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids inhibit platelet aggregation, caution is advised when fish oils are used concurrently with aspirin. Theoretically, the risk of bleeding may be increased. Moderate Because fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids inhibit platelet aggregation, caution is advised when fish oils are used concurrently with other platelet inhibitors.</p>
<p>Moderate Cod liver oil contains vitamin A and may increase the risk of bleeding if coadministered with platelet inhibitors. Colistimethate, Colistin, Polymyxin E: Major Theoretically, the chronic coadministration of these drugs may increase the risk of developing nephrotoxicity, even in patients who have normal renal function. Since colistimethate sodium is eliminated by the kidney, coadministration with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs, including salicylates, may increase serum concentrations of either drug.</p>
<p>Receipt of injectable collagenase may cause an ecchymosis or bleeding at the injection site. Moderate Cautious use of injectable collagenase by patients taking platelet inhibitors is advised.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of administering injectable collagenase to a patient taking a platelet inhibitor within 7 days before the injection are unknown. While there is controversy regarding the ulcerogenic potential of corticosteroids alone, concomitant administration of corticosteroids with aspirin may increase the GI toxicity of aspirin and other non-acetylated salicylates.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of corticosteroids can result in increased plasma concentrations of salicylate and possible toxicity. Although some patients may need to be given corticosteroids and NSAIDs concomitantly, which can be done successfully for short periods of time without sequelae, prolonged coadministration should be avoided.</p>
<p>Cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.: Minor Due to the inhibition of renal prostaglandins by salicylates, concurrent use of salicylates and other nephrotoxic agents like cyclosporine may lead to additive nephrotoxicity. Major Educate patients about the signs of increased bleeding and the need to report these signs to a healthcare provider immediately if coadministration of dabigatran and aspirin or another salicylate is necessary. Dabigatran can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding.</p>
<p>This risk may be increased by concurrent use of chronic salicylate therapy. Moderate Danazol can decrease hepatic synthesis of procoagulant factors, increasing the possibility of bleeding when used concurrently with platelet inhibitors. Moderate Salicylates can indirectly increase insulin secretion, decreasing blood glucose concentrations. In large doses, salicylates may cause hyperglycemia and glycosuria.</p>
<p>Large doses of aspirin should be used cautiously in patients receiving saxagliptin. Moderate Due to the thrombocytopenic and possible platelet inhibiting effects of dasatinib, an additive risk of bleeding may be seen in patients receiving concomitant platelet inhibitors. Moderate Because gastric ulceration and GI bleeding have been reported in patients taking deferasirox, use caution when coadministering with other drugs known to increase the risk of peptic ulcers or gastric hemorrhage including salicylates.</p>
<p>Severe Coadministration of defibrotide with antithrombotic agents like aspirin is contraindicated. The pharmacodynamic activity and risk of hemorrhage with antithrombotic agents are increased if coadministered with defibrotide.</p>
<p>If therapy with defibrotide is necessary, discontinue antithrombotic agents prior to initiation of defibrotide therapy. Consider delaying the onset of defibrotide treatment until the effects of the antithrombotic agent have abated. Severe Coadministration of defibrotide with antithrombotic agents like platelet inhibitors is contraindicated. Moderate An additive risk of bleeding may occur when platelet inhibitors are used with agents that cause clinically significant thrombocytopenia including antineoplastic agents, such as denileukin difitox.</p>
<p>Moderate Platelet aggregation may be impaired by serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRIs due to platelet serotonin depletion, possibly increasing the risk of a bleeding complication e. Patients should be instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding while taking an SNRI with a platelet inhibitor and to promptly report any bleeding events to the practitioner.</p>
<p>Major Dichlorphenamide is contraindicated with the concomitant use of high dose aspirin, ASA and should be used cautiously in patients receiving low dose aspirin. Dichlorphenamide may cause an elevation in salicylate concentrations in patients receiving aspirin. Adverse reactions including anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, and coma have been reported with the concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high dose aspirin.</p>
<p>Major Increased adverse gastrointestinal effects, including gastric ulceration or blood loss, are possible if diclofenac is used with salicylates. The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs should be avoided because this may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function.</p>
<p>Major The concurrent use of diflunisal and salicylates is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity with little or no increase in anti-inflammatory efficacy. Major The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs should be avoided because this may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function.</p>
<p>The FDA issued an advisory that mg of ibuprofen can interfere with the antiplatelet effects of low dose aspirin 81 mg per day. Routine use of ibuprofen is likely to have the most significant effect. The FDA recommends administering ibuprofen 8 hours before or 30 minutes after aspirin if concurrent therapy is needed. Interactions have been noted between ibuprofen and aspirin, ASA. Concurrent use of chronic ibuprofen therapy mg three times daily seems to antagonize the inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase COX -1 activity and impairment of platelet aggregation by low-dose aspirin 81 mg once daily per an ex vivo analysis.</p>
<p>In this study, diclofenac or rofecoxib therapy, agents with less activity at COX-1 than ibuprofen, did not affect inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin.</p>
<p>An in vitro study has shown that the antagonism of aspirin platelet inhibition probably involves competition at platelet-derived COX-1 and is related to the NSAIDs' ability to inhibit COX-1 mediated thromboxane B2 production in platelets.</p>
<p>Clinically, the interaction may be more dramatic with regular as compared with intermittent ibuprofen usage. Quantification of the risk was determined by the analysis of retrospective data, which may be inaccurate and incomplete. However, a trend towards a greater risk of a second myocardial infarction in the year after the initial event among adults taking daily aspirin was associated with a greater length of ibuprofen exposure.</p>
<p>Major Aspirin, ASA displaces naproxen from binding to albumin and increases naproxen excretion. Due to an increased free fraction of naproxen, increased adverse gastrointestinal effects are possible if naproxen is used with aspirin. In addition, further benefit with use of the two drugs as compared with aspirin monotherapy is not apparent, and antagonism of the irreversible platelet effect of aspirin occurs with concurrent use. The interaction appears to be due to competition at the enzyme active site.</p>
<p>Patients who take low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular health may have the beneficial effects of aspirin on platelet function counteracted by naproxen. Concomitant aspirin and naproxen use is not recommended. The use of Naproxen with other salicylates can also lead to additive GI toxicity. Moderate Although aspirin may be used in combination with dipyridamole, both drugs are associated with bleeding.</p>
<p>Major Treatment with drotrecogin alfa should be carefully considered in patients who are receiving or have received any platelet inhibitors within 7 days. These patients are at increased risk of bleeding during drotrecogin alfa therapy.</p>
<p>Major Treatment with drotrecogin alfa should be carefully considered in patients who are receiving or have received salicylates within 7 days. Caution should be used when drotrecogin alfa is used with any other drugs that affect hemostasis. Major Coadministration of edoxaban and platelet inhibitors should be avoided due to an increased risk of bleeding during concurrent use.</p>
<p>Occasionally, short-term coadministration may be necessary in patients transitioning to and from edoxaban. Long-term coadminstration is not recommended.</p>
<p>Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in patients on concomitant therapy. Major Monitor for bleeding in patients who require chronic treatment with aspirin. Concomitant use of edoxaban with drugs that affect hemostasis, such as aspirin, may increase the risk of bleeding. The coadministration of aspirin mg or mg and edoxaban increased bleeding time relative to that seen with either drug alone.</p>
<p>Minor Due to aspirin's effect on platelet aggregation and GI mucosa, aspirin should be used cautiously in patients with thrombocytopenia following treatment with antineoplastic agents due to an increased risk of bleeding. Efavirenz; Lamivudine; Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Large doses of aspirin should be used cautiously in patients receiving antidiabetic agents, such as linagliptin.</p>
<p>Emtricitabine; Rilpivirine; Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: Emtricitabine; Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: Moderate When used concurrently with platelet inhibitors, epoprostenol may increase the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>Moderate Unless contraindicated, aspirin is used in combination with eptifibatide. Moderate An additive risk of bleeding may occur when platelet inhibitors are used with agents that cause clinically significant thrombocytopenia including antineoplastic agents, such as estramustine. Major Concomitant ingestion of ethanol with salicylates, especially aspirin, ASA, increases the risk of developing gastric irritation and GI mucosal bleeding.</p>
<p>Ethanol and salicylates are mucosal irritants and aspirin decreases platelet aggregation. Routine ingestion of ethanol and aspirin can cause significant GI bleeding, which may or may not be overt. Even occasional concomitant use of salicylates and ethanol should be avoided. Chronic alcoholism is often associated with hypoprothrombinemia and this condition increases the risk of salicylate-induced bleeding. Patients should be warned regarding the potential for increased risk of GI bleeding if alcohol-containing beverages are taken concurrently with salicylates.</p>
<p>Minor Large doses of salicylates can displace hydantoins from plasma protein-binding sites. Although increased serum concentrations of unbound phenytoin may lead to phenytoin toxicity, the liver may also more rapidly clear unbound drug.</p>
<p>Major Monitor for an increase in etoposide-related adverse effects if etoposide, VP is coadministered with aspirin, ASA. Flavocoxid, Flavocoxid; Citrated Zinc Bisglycinate: Major Because flavocoxid has been associated with isolated cases of occult GI bleeding, additive pharmacodynamic effects may be seen in patients receiving salicylates. Avoid the concurrent use of flavocoxid with salicylates until further data are available.</p>
<p>Moderate Due to the thrombocytopenic effects of folate analogs, when used as antineoplastic agents, an additive risk of bleeding may be seen in patients receiving concomitant platelet inhibitors. Minor Due to the inhibition of renal prostaglandins by salicylates, concurrent use of salicylates and other nephrotoxic agents, such as foscarnet, may lead to additive nephrotoxicity.</p>
<p>Minor Large doses of salicylates can displace phenytoin from plasma protein-binding sites. Fosphenytoin is converted to phenytoin in vivo, so this interaction may also occur with fosphenytoin. Moderate Garlic, Allium sativum may produce clinically-significant antiplatelet effects; until more data are available, garlic should be used cautiously in patients receiving drugs with a potential risk for bleeding such as aspirin, ASA.</p>
<p>Moderate Use together with caution. Garlic produces clinically significant antiplatelet effects, and a risk for bleeding may occur if platelet inhibitors are given in combination with garlic.</p>
<p>Moderate Concurrent use of dipyridamole and gefitinib may lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Moderate Ginger inhibits thromboxane synthetase, a platelet aggregation inducer, and is a prostacyclin agonist so additive bleeding may occur if platelet inhibitors are given in combination with ginger, zingiber officinale. Moderate There may be an increased risk of bleeding in patients on aspirin therapy who take ginger as a supplement i.</p>
<p>Several pungent constituents of ginger, Zingiber officinale are reported to inhibit arachidonic acid induced platelet activation in human whole blood. The increased risk of bleeding is theoretical; clinical data of an interaction are not available. Major Avoid Ginkgo biloba in patients on aspirin therapy, as there is an increased risk of bleeding. Ginkgo biloba inhibits platelet aggregation; several case reports describe bleeding complications, with or without concomitant drug therapy.</p>
<p>Major Use Ginkgo biloba with caution in patients taking platelet inhibitors, as it can produce clinically-significant antiplatelet effects.</p>
<p>A compound found in Ginkgo biloba, ginkgolide-B, may act as a selective antagonist of platelet activating factor PAF. Although a review of Ginkgo biloba in stated that no known drug interactions exist, spontaneous hyphema has been reported in an elderly male who began taking Ginkgo while stabilized on daily aspirin. After ginkgo was stopped, no further bleeding was noted despite continuing the aspirin therapy.</p>
<p>Other clinical data exist that describe spontaneous subdural hematomas associated with chronic Ginkgo biloba ingestion.</p>
<p>Major Some green tea products contain caffeine. Methylxanthines have been associated with false-negative results during dipyridamole-thallium stress testing. However, because dipyridamole is a platelet inhibitor and green tea has demonstrated antiplatelet effects in animals, it may be prudent to avoid the concomitant use of green tea with chronic dipyridamole therapy as the risk of bleeding may be increased.</p>
<p>Moderate Green tea should be used cautiously in patients taking aspirin; there may be an increased risk of bleeding. Green tea has demonstrated antiplatelet and fibrinolytic actions in animals. Moderate Concurrent administration of griseofulvin with salicylates may result in decreased salicylate serum concentrations.</p>
<p>Caution and close monitoring for changes in the effectiveness of the salicylate are recommended. Major Caffeine is an active component of guarana. Methylxanthines, through antagonism of adenosine and thus pharmacologic-induced coronary vasodilation, have been associated with false-negative results during dipyridamole-thallium stress testing. It is recommended that methylxanthines caffeine, caffeinated beverages, foods, and dietary supplements such as guarana, theophylline, etc.</p>
<p>Moderate Guarana has been shown to possess minor antiplatelet activity and, therefore, concurrent use of guarana and anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors should be avoided. Despite the potential drug-drug interaction between aspirin and heparin, heparin is frequently administered in combination with low-dose aspirin therapy to patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction and in other disease states.</p>
<p>Hyaluronidase, Recombinant; Immune Globulin: Moderate Immune Globulin IG products have been reported to be associated with renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death. Patients predisposed to acute renal failure include patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs and salicylates.</p>
<p>Coadminister IG products at the minimum concentration available and the minimum rate of infusion practicable. Also, closely monitor renal function. Minor Salicylates, when given in large systemic doses, may render tissues partially resistant to the action of hyaluronidase. Patients receiving these medications may require larger amounts of hyaluronidase for equivalent dispersing effect.</p>
<p>Symptomatic treatment is usually enough to bring these conditions under control. However, if people experience sudden, more severe side effects, it is imperative to bring this to the immediate attention of a doctor.</p>
<p>Possible side effects of this nature include weakness, severe nausea, severe stomach aches, joint pain, high fever, and ringing in the ears. Patients may also experience allergic reactions like sudden swelling of the tongue, throat, and lips. These are serious symptoms that need to be dealt with immediately. Precautions Before using Aggrenox, you should discuss your medical history in detail with your doctor. For people with a history of liver disease, kidney disorders, heart disease, low blood pressure, or stomach ulcers, it is important to ascertain whether it is possible to administer Aggrenox.</p>
<p>The medication is also not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. People who have at any point been allergic to either aspirin or dipyridamole should avoid Aggrenox altogether.</p></p>
