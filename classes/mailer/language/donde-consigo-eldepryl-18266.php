		<p><p>Signs and symptoms of central nervous system stimulation, including convulsions, should be treated with diazepam, given slowly intravenously. Phenothiazine derivatives and central nervous system stimulants should be avoided. Hypotension and vascular collapse should be treated with intravenous fluids and, if necessary, blood pressure titration with an intravenous infusion of a dilute pressor agent.</p>
<p>It should be noted that adrenergic agents may produce a markedly increased pressor response. Respiration should be supported by appropriate measures, including management of the airway, use of supplemental oxygen , and mechanical ventilatory assistance, as required. Body temperature should be monitored closely. Intensive management of hyperpyrexia may be required. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential. This contraindication is often extended to other opioids.</p>
<p>Inhibition of monoamine oxidase, type B, activity is generally considered to be of primary importance; in addition, there is evidence that selegiline may act through other mechanisms to increase dopaminergic activity. Selegiline is best known as an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase MAO , an intracellular enzyme associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria.</p>
<p>Because selegiline has greater affinity for type B rather than for type A active sites, it can serve as a selective inhibitor of MAO type B if it is administered at the recommended dose. MAOs are widely distributed throughout the body; their concentration is especially high in liver , kidney , stomach , intestinal wall, and brain.</p>
<p>MAOs are currently subclassified into two types, A and B, which differ in their substrate specificity and tissue distribution. In CNS neurons, MAO plays an important role in the catabolism of catecholamines dopamine , norepinephrine and epinephrine and serotonin. MAOs are also important in the catabolism of various exogenous amines found in a variety of foods and drugs. MAO in the GI tract and liver primarily type A , for example, is thought to provide vital protection from exogenous amines e.</p>
<p>Subsequent release of the displaced norepinephrine causes the rise in systemic blood pressure , etc. In theory, since MAO A of the gut is not inhibited, patients treated with selegiline at a dose of 10 mg a day should be able to take medications containing pharmacologically active amines and consume tyramine-containing foods without risk of uncontrolled hypertension.</p>
<p>Although rare, a few reports of hypertensive reactions have occurred in patients receiving Eldepryl selegiline hcl at the recommended dose, with tyramine-containing foods. In addition, one case of hypertensive crisis has been reported in a patient taking the recommended dose of selegiline and a sympathomimetic medication, ephedrine. The pathophysiology of the 'cheese reaction' is complicated and, in addition to its ability to inhibit MAO B selectively, selegiline's relative freedom from this reaction has been attributed to an ability to prevent tyramine and other indirect acting sympathomimetics from displacing norepinephrine from adrenergic neurons.</p>
<p>However, until the pathophysiology of the cheese reaction is more completely understood, it seems prudent to assume that selegiline can ordinarily only be used safely without dietary restrictions at doses where it presumably selectively inhibits MAO B e. In short, attention to the dose dependent nature of selegiline's selectivity is critical if it is to be used without elaborate restrictions being placed on diet and concomitant drug use although, as noted above, a few cases of hypertensive reactions have been reported at the recommended dose.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware that selegiline may have pharmacological effects unrelated to MAO B inhibition. As noted above, there is some evidence that it may increase dopaminergic activity by other mechanisms, including interfering with dopamine re-uptake at the synapse.</p>
<p>Effects resulting from selegiline administration may also be mediated through its metabolites. Two of its three principal metabolites, amphetamine and methamphetamine, have pharmacological actions of their own; they interfere with neuronal uptake and enhance release of several neurotransmitters e.</p>
<p>However, the extent to which these metabolites contribute to the effects of selegiline are unknown. Rationale for the Use of a Selective Monoamine Oxidase Type B Inhibitor in Parkinson's Disease Many of the prominent symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to a deficiency of striatal dopamine that is the consequence of a progressive degeneration and loss of a population of dopaminergic neurons which originate in the substantia nigra of the midbrain and project to the basal ganglia or striatum.</p>
<p>Early in the course of Parkinson's Disease, the deficit in the capacity of these neurons to synthesize dopamine can be overcome by administration of exogenous levodopa, usually given in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa. Thus, after several years of levodopa treatment, the response, for a given dose of levodopa, is shorter, has less predictable onset and offset i.</p>
<p>This deteriorating response is currently interpreted as a manifestation of the inability of the ever decreasing population of intact nigrostriatal neurons to synthesize and release adequate amounts of dopamine. MAO B inhibition may be useful in this setting because, by blocking the catabolism of dopamine, it would increase the net amount of dopamine available i.</p>
<p>Whether or not this mechanism or an alternative one actually accounts for the observed beneficial effects of adjunctive selegiline is unknown.</p>
<p>Whether or not it might be effective as a sole treatment is unknown, but past attempts to treat Parkinson's disease with non-selective MAOI monotherapy are reported to have been unsuccessful. Foods that you MAY eat include: For best results, keep taking the medicine as prescribed.</p>
<p>Store this medicine at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Dosage Information in more detail What happens if I miss a dose? Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. What happens if I overdose? Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at  Overdose symptoms may include severe headache, hallucinations, vision problems, sweating, cool or clammy skin, fast or uneven heart rate, feeling light-headed, fainting, or seizure convulsions.</p>
<p>What should I avoid while taking Eldepryl? Avoid drinking alcohol while you are taking Eldepryl. While taking Eldepryl and for 14 days after you stop, you must NOT eat foods that are high in tyramine, including: Eating tyramine while you are using selegiline can raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels which could cause life-threatening side effects.</p>
<p>You should become very familiar with the list of foods to avoid while you are using Eldepryl. Eldepryl may impair your thinking or reactions. Some people taking this medicine have fallen asleep during normal daytime activities such as working, talking, eating, or driving.</p>
<p>You may fall asleep suddenly, even after feeling alert. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert. Eldepryl side effects Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Eldepryl: Call your doctor at once if you have: These reports have occurred in a setting of pre-existing somnolence. Impaired memory and myoclonic jerks were reported at doses greater than 10 mg per day.</p>
<p>Seizure in dialyzed chronic renal failure in a patient treated with selegiline on concomitant medications has been reported in postmarketing experience. A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in, antiparkinson therapy.</p>
<p>There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal cases of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of this drug with antidepressants.</p>
<p>Headache was reported as a very common side effect in placebo-controlled clinical trials for major depressive disorder with transdermal selegiline. Postural hypotension was reported with selegiline the active ingredient contained in Eldepryl in double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials at a higher frequency when used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in the earlier phases of Parkinson's disease compared to the late phase.</p>
