		<p><p>It is hinted at that he and Glanton have forged some manner of a pact, possibly for the very lives of the gang members. He gradually becomes the antagonist to the kid after the dissolution of Glanton's gang, occasionally having brief reunions with the kid to mock, debate, or terrorize him. Unlike the rest of the gang, Holden is socially refined and remarkably well-educated; however, he perceives the world as an ultimately violent fatalistic and liable to an endless cycle of bloody conquest, with human nature and autonomy defined by the will to violence; he asserts, ultimately, that "War is god.</p>
<p>A seasoned outlaw the kid originally encounters in a vicious brawl and who then burns down a hotel, Toadvine is distinguished by his head which has no ears and his forehead branded with the letters H, T, standing for "horse thief" and F. He later reappears unexpectedly as a cellmate of the kid in the Chihuahua prison. Here, he somewhat befriends the kid, negotiating his and the kid's release in return for joining Glanton's gang, to whom he claims dishonestly that he and the kid are experienced scalp hunters.</p>
<p>Toadvine is not as depraved as the rest of the gang and opposes the judge's methods ineffectually, but is still a violent individual himself. He is hanged in Los Angeles alongside David Brown. Captain White, or "the captain": An ex-professional soldier and American supremacist who believes that Mexico is a lawless nation destined to be conquered by the United States, Captain White leads a ragtag group of militants into Mexico.</p>
<p>The kid joins Captain White's escapades before his capture and imprisonment; he later discovers that White has been decapitated by his enemies. Glanton is the American leader sometimes deemed "captain" of a band of scalphunters who murder Indians as well as Mexican civilians and militants alike.</p>
<p>His history and appearance are not clarified, except that he is physically small with black hair and has a wife and child in Texas though he has been banned from returning there because of his criminal record.</p>
<p>A clever strategist, his last major action is to seize control of a profitable Colorado River ferry, which leads him and most of his gang to be killed in an ambush by Yuma Indians. Tobin, or "the ex-priest": A former novice of the Society of Jesus , Ben Tobin instead turns to a life of crime in Glanton's gang, though remains deeply religious. He feels an apparently friend-like bond with the kid and abhors the judge and his philosophy; he and the judge gradually become great spiritual enemies.</p>
<p>Although he survives the Yuma massacre of Glanton's gang, during his escape in the desert he is shot in the neck by the judge and seeks medical attention in San Diego. His ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.</p>
<p>An especially radical member of the Glanton band, David Brown becomes known for his dramatic displays of violence. He wears a necklace of human ears similar to the one worn by Bathcat before his immolation. He is arrested in San Diego and sought out by Glanton personally, who seems especially concerned to see him freed though Brown ends up securing his own release.</p>
<p>Though he survives the Yuma massacre, he is captured with Toadvine in Los Angeles and both are hanged. After trying to drive the black Jackson away from a campfire with a racist remark, the white one is decapitated by the black one; the black Jackson later becomes the first person murdered in the Yuma massacre.</p>

April Violence[ edit ] A major theme is the warlike nature of man. Critic Harold Bloom [6] praised Blood Meridian as one of the best 20th century American novels, describing it as "worthy of Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick ," [7] but admitted that he found the book's pervasive violence so shocking that he had several false starts before reading the book entirely.</p>
<p>Caryn James argued that the novel's violence was a "slap in the face" to modern readers cut off from the brutality of life, while Terrence Morgan thought that, though initially shocking, the effect of the violence gradually waned until the reader was bored. Stratton contends that the brutality depicted is the primary mechanism through which McCarthy challenges binaries and promotes his revisionist agenda. In McCarthy's work, violence tends to be just that; it is not a sign or symbol of something else.</p>
<p>The fact that the kid's death is not depicted might be significant. Blood Meridian is a catalog of brutality, depicting, in sometimes explicit detail, all manner of violence, bloodshed, brutality and cruelty. For the dramatic climax to be left undepicted leaves something of a vacuum for the reader: Shaw argues that Holden has sexually violated the protagonist.</p>
<p>As Shaw writes, the novel had several times earlier established "a sequence of events that gives us ample information to visualize how Holden molests a child, then silences him with aggression. If the judge wanted only to kill the kid, there would be no need for him to undress as he waited in the outhouse.</p>
<p>Shaw writes, When the judge assaults the kid in the Fort Griffin jakes… he betrays a complex of psychological, historical and sexual values of which the kid has no conscious awareness, but which are distinctly conveyed to the reader.
