            <h1>Desyrel barato Phoenix - Side Effects</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Compared to the reversible MAOI antidepressant drug moclobemide , significantly more impairment of vigilance occurs with trazodone. Arrhythmia identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes three to four beats of ventricular tachycardia. Several post-marketing reports have been made of arrhythmia in trazodone-treated patients who have pre-existing cardiac disease and in some patients who did not have pre-existing cardiac disease. Until the results of prospective studies are available, patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should be closely monitored, particularly for cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Concomitant administration of drugs that prolong the QT interval or that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. These side effects wane over time and do not need treatment. However, you must consult your doctor if they persist or worsen. Some people may also experience severe side effects after taking a dose of Desyrel.</p>
<p>Fainting, general ill feeling, chest pain, fever, flu symptoms, chills, lightheadedness, body aches, pain spreading to the shoulder or arm, problems with urination, or sweating are some of the severe side effects associated with the drug. In rare cases, Desyrel may cause allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing and swelling of the lips, throat, face, or tongue.</p>
<p>Consult your doctor immediately if you notice any severe side effects or allergic reactions after taking a dose of Desyrel. Seek medical attention immediately if you have a painful erection or if the erection lasts for 4 hours or longer.</p>
<p>Indications and Usage for Desyrel Desyrel is indicated for the treatment of depression. The efficacy of Desyrel has been demonstrated in both inpatient and outpatient settings and for depressed patients with and without prominent anxiety.</p>
<p>Contraindications Desyrel is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Desyrel. There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients. Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior suicidality in short-term studies in children and adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder MDD and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of 9 antidepressant drugs SSRIs and others in children and adolescents with MDD, OCD, or other psychiatric disorders a total of 24 trials involving over patients have revealed a greater risk of adverse events representing suicidal behavior or thinking suicidality during the first few months of treatment in those receiving antidepressants.</p>
<p>There was considerable variation in risk among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase for almost all drugs studied. The risk of suicidality was most consistently observed in the MDD trials, but there were signals of risk arising from some trials in other psychiatric indications obsessive compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder as well.</p>
<p>No suicides occurred in any of these trials. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk in pediatric patients extends to longer-term use, ie, beyond several months. It is also unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to adults.</p>
<p>All pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</p>
<p>Such observation would generally include at least weekly face-to-face contact with patients or their family members or caregivers during the first 4 weeks of treatment, then every other week visits for the next 4 weeks, then at 12 weeks, and as clinically indicated beyond 12 weeks. Additional contact by telephone may be appropriate between face-to-face visits.</p>
<p>Adults with MDD or co-morbid depression in the setting of other psychiatric illness being treated with antidepressants should be observed similarly for clinical worsening and suicidality, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</p>
<p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia psychomotor restlessness , hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>Families and caregivers of pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers.</p>
<p>Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Desyrel should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</p>
<p>Families and caregivers of adults being treated for depression should be similarly advised. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Desyrel is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at  An overdose of trazodone can be fatal when it is taken with alcohol, barbiturates such as phenobarbital, or sedatives such as diazepam Valium.</p>
<p>Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, vomiting, penis erection that is painful or prolonged, fast or pounding heartbeat, seizure black-out or convulsions , or breathing that slows or stops. What should I avoid while taking Desyrel trazodone? Do not drink alcohol. Trazodone can increase the effects of alcohol, which could be dangerous. Avoid getting up too fast from a sitting or lying position, or you may feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Get up slowly and steady yourself to prevent a fall. Trazodone may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert. Ask your doctor before taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug NSAID for pain, arthritis, fever, or swelling. This includes aspirin, ibuprofen Advil, Motrin , naproxen Aleve , celecoxib Celebrex , diclofenac, indomethacin, meloxicam, and others.</p>
<p>Desyrel trazodone side effects Stop taking trazodone and call your doctor at once if you have a penis erection that is painful or lasts 6 hours or longer.</p></p>

It is impossible to determine precisely what accounts for the differences observed. Take Oleptro on an empty stomach at bedtime or late in the evening.
