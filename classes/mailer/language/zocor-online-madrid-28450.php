		<p><p>However, higher doses of simvastatin precluded colony growth at all, because zero colonies grew. Triple treatment augmented XRT alone cell killing by a factor of 5. Second, and more importantly, the impact of simvastatin on the triple treatment was clearly significant as indicated by the outcomes showing decreases in clonogenic survival by a factor of 1.</p>
<p>Moreover, in both cell lines, double treatment with hour C exposure was less effective than C alone, an observation that suggests the participation of an early acceleration of cell proliferation, a radiation-induced reaction already described in A cell line by Schmidt-Ullrich and co-workers [19].</p>
<p>Taken together, the in vitro results suggest that simvastatin could decrease cell proliferation in combination with XRT and C, being its effect potentiated in long-term drug exposures, and provide new insights about the triple combination. Simvastatin Slowed the Growth of Xenografts Treated with XRT and Cetuximab Because of preliminary in vitro findings indicating a possible activity of simvastatin as cell proliferation inhibitor in combination with C and XRT, this study was continued to investigate simvastatin role in xenografts.</p>
<p>In tumors derived from FaDu and A cell lines, single treatment with simvastatin alone had no effect on tumor growth. To focus on the main interest of this study, we started experiments irradiating FaDu tumors with 3 Gy per day for 10 days in combination with C in the presence or absence of simvastatin. After that, tumor growth rebounded but showed lower rates of regrowth when the animals received simvastatin. From the start of XRT, the time for the tumor volume to triple in size was  Consistently with a simvastatin-induced enhancement in tumor growth inhibition, the growth delay after irradiation for the tumors treated with simvastatin was  Although these experiments were not statistically significant, they were suggestive of an antitumor effect, in line with the results we observed for FaDu tumors.</p>
<p>Regarding animals' global health status, no differences were observed in between groups related to mouse weight and physical or clinical appearance. Because in vivo, and in vitro, findings were compatible with the notion that simvastatin could enhance the antitumor effect of XRT and C in FaDu and A cell—derived tumors, we decided to evaluate if simvastatin could have a negative influence on the biology of these tumors.</p>
<p>Simvastatin Induced Apoptosis after XRT plus Cetuximab We hypothesized that the effect of simvastatin might be related to apoptosis activation.</p>
<p>To evaluate this possibility, we determined the cleaved caspase-3, a surrogate marker that indicates irreversible cell death through apoptosis. To validate these in vitro findings and establish whether apoptosis was increased by simvastatin in FaDu and A cells treated with XRT and C, xenograft tumors were sampled as previously described.</p>
<p>Although the tumors received only 3 days of treatment and the percentages of apoptotic cells were relatively low, we already found that the number of cleaved caspase-3—positive cells was significantly higher in FaDu-derived tumors treated with triple treatment at this time point 1. The same observation was made in Aderived tumors 4.</p>
<p>Simvastatin was associated with apoptosis in xenografts. Tumors were extirpated on the fourth day, 24 hours after the last treatment. Simvastatin Interfered with Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Cells Treated with XRT and Cetuximab We also investigated whether simvastatin could affect crucial cellular signaling pathways involved in the malignant phenotype of cancers.</p>
<p>We found that the ionizing radiation elicited the phosphorylation of EGFR on tyrosine  In contrast, C had an inhibitory effect on the radiation-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, which was neither changed in the presence of simvastatin, indicating that simvastatin had little effect on EGFR at least on phosphorylated tyrosine  A Western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of proteins as it is shown.</p>
<p>Discussion In this study, we preclinically explored whether a treatment regime involving the addition of simvastatin to XRT and C merits further research. Although early time points explored in scratch and proliferation assays did not provide a clear clue on the effectiveness of simvastatin, it was shown that the addition of simvastatin for 48 hours or more significantly decreased proliferation and clonogenic survival of cells treated with XRT and C Moreover, we used an experimental model with tumor cells derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx that suggests that simvastatin may increase the antitumor effect of XRT plus C—at doses and fractions of XRT that mimic doses administered in the clinical setting.</p>
<p>The concentrations of these compounds were selected based on our previous studies 11 , 12 , and the above-mentioned time points were chosen based on our previous work evaluating invasiveness of HES cells  The reaction was terminated after 24 hours of treatment by removing the medium and adding 0.</p>
<p>Afterward, individual bands were cut and transferred into scintillation vials for radioactivity measurements of [14C]cholesterol and [3H]cholesterol. After drying the TLC plates, mevalonic acid lactone bands were visualized by iodine vapor staining, the bands were scraped into scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was determined using a scintillation counter. The human primer sequences were as follows: Relative concentrations of mRNA of interest were normalized to 18S.</p>
<p>Western blot analysis After 48 hours of treatments, HES cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and processed as previously described 4. Briefly, pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer Invitrogen containing protease inhibitor cocktail Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana and sonicated twice for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay Bio-Rad, Hercules, California , following the manufacturer's instructions. Band intensities were quantified using the Odyssey version 3. Normality of distribution was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk W test. As illustrated in Figure 1 A, resveratrol and simvastatin, each, induced a concentration-dependent inhibition after 24 hours of treatment compared with control. Simvastatin at concentrations of 0.</p>
<p>To determine the interactive effects of simvastatin and resveratrol, HES cells were treated without control or with simvastatin 0.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the prespecified efficacy parameters were selected and the study was designed so that either frank progression or absence of progression would fail to meet the primary end point.</p>
<p>Only regression, defined as a reduction in IVUS measures of atheroma burden with CIs not including zero, would yield a successful outcome. Despite the higher standard of evidence required, the current study demonstrated regression for all 3 prespecified IVUS end points with a high level of statistical significance Table 3.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows a representative cross-section at baseline and follow-up for a patient who exhibited marked regression of disease. Regression was achieved by reducing LDL-C levels to a mean of  The achieved LDL-C levels were the lowest values ever observed in a statin atherosclerosis progression trial, and the magnitude of the HDL-C increase also exceeded effects reported in previous statin trials.</p>
<p>Prior well-designed IVUS studies of statin therapy have not yielded compelling evidence for regression. Two small, single-center studies have suggested reduction in disease burden following statin therapy, but design limitations make interpretation difficult.</p>
<p>Moreover, arteries undergoing mechanical interventions were included, which could have affected atheroma measurements. No large-scale IVUS trials in which patients received statins have demonstrated statistically significant regression. In the current study, the choice of 2 primary efficacy parameters allowed testing of drug effects on regression using 2 different standards of evidence. The change in the mm segment with the most severe disease is analogous to the methods used by investigators who examined only short segments with visible angiographic disease.</p>
<p>Percent atheroma volume assesses drug effects within the full arterial pullback and represents the highest standard of evidence for regression. Using this more conservative end point, only a small study of patients administered an intravenous HDL-C mimetic apolipoprotein A-1 Milano phospholipid has previously shown regression. Because contemporary guidelines and practice patterns require intensive treatment of secondary prevention patients, randomization of patients with established coronary disease to placebo or a low-intensity statin regimen was deemed ethically unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the current trial, each pair of baseline and follow-up IVUS images underwent digital processing to remove date identifiers, performed by technicians not otherwise involved in the study. The paired studies were then randomly resequenced using codes provided by an outside statistician.</p>
<p>This procedure blinded technicians from knowing whether an examination was obtained at baseline or follow-up and thereby eliminated any systematic bias in measurement of paired studies.</p>
<p>The magnitude and consistency of regression observed in the current trial are noteworthy. Table 4 demonstrates that regression occurred in virtually all subgroups, including men and women, older and younger patients, and most subgroups defined by lipid levels.</p>
<p>Despite the known limitations of cross-trial comparisons, many observers will likely compare these results with other recent IVUS regression-progression trials. When viewed in this context, the results of the current study demonstrate that there exists no apparent threshold LDL-C level beyond which the benefits of statin therapy are no longer evident.</p>
<p>If regression of disease is the desired outcome, then lower LDL-C is better. We believe that the current study has important implications for understanding the pathophysiology and optimal treatment of coronary artery disease. Traditional thinking has viewed atherosclerosis as an inexorably progressive disease for which even the most active therapies can merely slow advancement.</p>
<p>The current study suggests that there is potential for a more optimistic strategy, in which aggressive lipid-modulating strategies can actually reverse the atherosclerotic disease process. The observed increases in HDL-C in the current study suggest that therapies designed to simultaneously lower LDL-C while raising HDL-C have the potential to substantially reduce lesion burden in patients with established disease.</p>
<p>This isn't so noted for brain swelling and rational development. The media make mediocre jobs public information. Second, the normal wellbeing at the population excellence appears to be reasonably limited, requiring realistic expectations.

<p>Not only do corn and soy oils provide the oxidized fats that cause heart disease, they raise cholesterol levels in the process. Restoring thyroid function brings cholesterol down to normal. It is thought that the majority of Americans now have low thyroid levels. Bromide and chlorine suppress the uptake of iodine, an essential nutrient for optimal thyroid function.</p>
<p>Corn oil and soybean oil also suppress thyroid function. Sunlight converts the cholesterol on your skin to hormone precursors which are used to make steroid hormones like vitamin D.</p>
<p>The cholesterol in your bloodstream then migrates to the surface of the skin, to replace the cholesterol that was converted. Staying out of the sun and routine use of sunscreens is an invitation to increased cholesterol levels. Linus Pauling met Dr. Rath shared with Dr. Pauling his hunch that if you were low in vitamin C you produced more LDL cholesterol. The reverse is also true; if you have more vitamin C, you produce less LDL cholesterol. Instead, we die later from heart disease.</p>
<p>Vitamin E is also a potent stimulant for production of prostanoids which dilate the arteries. Muscle cells then multiply inside the connective tissue to strengthen the wall. Such thickened artery walls increase the risk for stroke and heart disease. The more stress you have, the more corticosteroid hormones you need.</p>
<p>When you lower cholesterol with drugs, you get more stress-related problems. Any possible protective effect of high cholesterol may therefore be counteracted by the negative influence of the artificially lowered levels of cholesterol on the vascular system. The role of infections in chronic heart failure has been studied by Dr. His research team found that the strongest predictor of death for patients with chronic heart failure was the concentration of cytokines in the blood, in particular in patients with heart failure due to coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>That myth is the greatest scientific deception of this century, perhaps of any century. It looks more and more as though the anti-inflammatory effects of statins may be the main source of their cardiac benefits, rather than their ability to lower cholesterol.</p>

But the nature of saturated fat has been changed by modern farming methods into a form which is unhealthy for the structure of the cell wall. These results were reflected in xenoimplanted tumors growing into subcutaneous tissue of athymic mice where concomitant treatment with simvastatin decreased tumor growth.
