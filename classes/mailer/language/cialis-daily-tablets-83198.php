		<p><p>Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy NAION , a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors.</p>
<p>A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa , were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. Consideration should be given to the following: Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.</p>
<p>In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose.</p>
<p>Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs.</p>
<p>Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol e. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone.</p>
<p>CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution.</p>
<p>Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV should be considered. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients should be counseled that concomitant use of CIALIS with nitrates could cause blood pressure to suddenly drop to an unsafe level, resulting in dizziness, syncope , or even heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular Considerations Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Priapism There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration for this class of compounds.</p>
<p>Physicians should advise patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, to seek emergency medical attention.</p>
<p>Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy NAION , a cause of decreased vision, including possible permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors.</p>
<p>Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV should be considered. In most patients, the ability to have sexual intercourse is improved for up to 36 hours. Cialis is effective at improving erectile function over the course of therapy. Systemic drug exposures, as measured by AUC of unbound tadalafil, were approximately fold for mice, and and fold for male and female rats, respectively, the exposures in human males given Maximum Recommended Human Dose MRHD of 20 mg.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis Tadalafil was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial Ames assays or the forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells. Tadalafil was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes or the in vivo rat micronucleus assays.</p>
<p>Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive performance. Safety and efficacy in patients below the age of 18 years has not been established. Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ED clinical studies of tadalafil, approximately 19 percent were 65 and over, while approximately 2 percent were 75 and over. No dose adjustment is warranted based on age alone. However, a greater sensitivity to medications in some older individuals should be considered.</p>
<p>Hepatic Impairment In clinical pharmacology studies, tadalafil exposure AUC in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment Child-Pugh Class A or B was comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg was administered. There are no available data for doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil in patients with hepatic impairment.</p>
<p>In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours.</p>
<p>When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic e.</p>
<p>In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Across placebo-controlled studies with Cialis for use as needed for ED, diarrhea was reported more frequently in patients 65 years of age and older who were treated with Cialis 2.</p>
<p>A causal relationship of these events to Cialis is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
<p>Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Cialis without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Cialis and sexual activity.</p>
<p>It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Cialis, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy NAION , a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including Cialis.</p>
<p>Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including Cialis. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited.</p>
<p>It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of Cialis, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions 5. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions 5. Drug Interactions Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Cialis Nitrates — Administration of Cialis to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated.</p>
<p>In clinical pharmacology studies, Cialis was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken Cialis, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of Cialis before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration 2.</p>
<p>PDE5 inhibitors, including Cialis, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol.</p>
<p>Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore, this combination is not recommended see section 4.</p>
<p>In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and progressively adjusted. In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive medicinal products was examined.</p>
<p>Tadalafil 10 mg, except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was applied had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives.</p>
<p>In subjects taking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater, although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects.</p>
<p>In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which with the exception of alpha-blockers - see above is, in general, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of Phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products.</p>
<p>However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products. Riociguat Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population studied.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated see section 4. However, as a formal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 5-ARIs has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 5-ARIs.</p>
<p>The only pharmacodynamic effect was a small 3. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products. Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence of this is uncertain.</p>
<p>Alcohol Alcohol concentrations mean maximum blood concentration 0. In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after co-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol absorption overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol. Tadalafil 20 mg did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol 0. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol 0.</p>
<p>The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil 10 mg. Cytochrome P metabolised medicinal products Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal products metabolised by CYP isoforms.</p>
<p>R-warfarin Tadalafil 10 mg and 20 mg had no clinically significant effect on exposure AUC to S-warfarin or R-warfarin CYP2C9 substrate , nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. Aspirin Tadalafil 10 mg and 20 mg did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetylsalicylic acid.</p>
<p>Antidiabetic medicinal products Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted. Pregnancy There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Fertility Effects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies suggest that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men see sections 5.</p></p>
